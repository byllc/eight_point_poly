Simple Eight Point Polyhedron in OpenScad
================

I needed a quick way to make eight point polyhedrons with 6 walls but not necessarily cubed.
It is best used for reproducing a real object by measuring each of the parameterized edges and hypoteneuse. 
The comments in the script attempt to explain the orientation of the polynomial. 

The code was able to create the shape that I needed and has not yet be fully generalized for other use cases.
